README

This is my approach to the source code for the great Hibernate tutorial by Koushik. 

You can view and/or change the database connection configuration (as well as other parameters) in the hibernate.cfg file under de src/ directory.

Don't hesitate to check the tutorial!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv2xctJxE-w&list=PL4AFF701184976B25
